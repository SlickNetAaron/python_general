# Exercise from https://realpython.com/python-dice-roll/

I skipped the ascii stuff, as I generally don't think that's too applicable to my practice.

 - dice_initial.py is me following the tutorial, using their structure, but trying to write my own code

 - dice_v1_simple.py is my crafting on my own, in a basic imperative script

 - dice_v2_simple_functional.py is adapting v1 to use more functional and use a main() function. I also improved on the original by including a loop so you don't have to run the program every time you want to roll again.

 - dice_guided.py is fully following the Real Python tutorial
